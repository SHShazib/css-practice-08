            <p>There are some birds, such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, orioles, among others, that serve as pollinators, which means they move pollen from one flower to another. Pollination helps in fertilization and promotes the development and evolution of trees.The relationship between birds and treen is usually commensal. The bird gains shelter, shade, food from insects within, or from its flowers, while the tree remains unbothered. A small portion of birds may help the trees pollinate but they are the minority. This is one case of mutualism, bird and tree both benefit. Some birds, like the woodpecker can damage the tree. The sapsucker bird can kill entire trees. In these cases it is a parasitic relationship wherein the tree is negatively affected, while the bird prospers.</p>
